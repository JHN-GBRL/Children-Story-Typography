              <h3><p><b>The moral of “The Fox And The Stork” story is “People will treat you the same way you treat them.” </b></h3>
              <h5><p><b> In this story, the fox makes fun of the stork by offering him dinner in a dish he knows he won’t be able to eat in. </b></h5>
              <h5><p><b> To teach the clever fox a lesson, the stork invited the fox to dinner and did what the fox did to him. Served food in a container that fox won’t be able to eat from. </b></h5>
              <h5><p><b> Although the stork was good-natured, when he saw that his neighbour did all this just for fun, he wanted to teach him a lesson.</b></h5>
              <h5><p><b> The stork wanted to teach the fox that others would treat him the same way he treats others. This way, the fox learned an important moral lesson.</b></h5>
